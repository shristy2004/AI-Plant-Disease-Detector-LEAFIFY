# 🌿 LEAFIFY  
## AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection System

An intelligent web application that detects plant diseases from leaf images using **Deep Learning (CNN)** and provides instant analysis through a modern, responsive interface.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**LEAFIFY** is an AI-based plant disease detection system that enables users to:

- 📸 Upload a plant leaf image  
- 🧠 Analyze the image using a trained CNN model  
- 🌱 Detect plant disease with prediction confidence  
- 📊 Visualize model training performance  

This project integrates **Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Full-Stack Web Development** to create a practical agricultural solution.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. User uploads a plant leaf image through the web interface.  
2. Image is processed using **OpenCV & Pillow**.  
3. Image data is converted into tensors using **NumPy**.  
4. A trained **CNN model (PyTorch)** predicts the disease class.  
5. FastAPI returns the prediction response.  
6. React frontend displays the result with confidence score.
